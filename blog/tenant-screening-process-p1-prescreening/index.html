      <h1 class="mb-3">Tenant Screening Guide for Landlords in Ontario, Canada</h1>
  
        <p class="text-secondary">Jul 06, 2025 by <a href="#">mtxvp</a></p>
        <p>Tenant screening is a <strong>multi-stage process</strong> that needs to be carefully followed to help you find the best candidate for your rental property. This is one step you don‚Äôt want to compromise on ‚Äî selecting a solid tenant will ensure your <strong>peace of mind</strong> for months (or even years) to come. A good tenant means a smoother landlord-tenant relationship, someone who takes care of your property, and a reliable income stream ‚Äî while you provide a well-maintained space they can enjoy.</p>
<p>There are plenty of services and forms out there that help with tenant screening. But many of them jump right into asking for highly sensitive details like banking info, credit scores, and employment history. While these are useful later, going in too deep too soon can feel invasive ‚Äî and turn away quality applicants.</p>
<p>üìç <em>Note: This and subsequent guides are written with Ontario, Canada in mind. If you're outside the province, please check your local laws and regulations.</em></p>
<p>At <strong>TenantFit</strong>, we believe that tenant candidates should have a chance to remain <strong>anonymous</strong> at the beginning of the process. Only after a landlord has narrowed down their shortlist should they request more personal information. This respects the privacy of applicants while giving landlords better control over their screening efforts.</p>
<p>This approach also helps landlords. In Ontario, you're <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/06r17#BK207">strongly discouraged from charging</a> tenants for background screening. So it makes sense to keep early screening light and only dive deep when it‚Äôs worth the effort.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="stage-1-pre-screening">Stage 1: Pre-Screening</h2>
<p>To collect initial information, you‚Äôve got a couple of options.</p>
<h3 id="option-1-old-school">üìù Option 1: Old School</h3>
<p>Prefer pen and paper? You can use this <a href="files/2025-07-06-tenantfit-pre-screening-form-v1-onca.pdf" target="_blank">Pre-Screening application PDF form</a> and send it directly to the candidate. They print it, fill it out, scan it, and send it back. Then you manually assess who‚Äôs worth moving to the next step.</p>
<h3 id="option-2-online-and-easier">üåê Option 2: Online (and easier!)</h3>
<p><a href="https://tenantfit.mtxvp.com/#register">Register for free</a>, <a href="https://tenantfit.mtxvp.com/blog/tenantfit-open-registration/">add your property</a>, and send the link to the interactive form to candidates. They fill it in on their phone or computer, and you get clean, structured responses you can compare at a glance.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs an example <a href="https://tenantfit.mtxvp.com/#publicProperty?id=03980949-b29d-47c2-a001-3b226f704788">public listing link</a>.</p>
<p>TenantFit stores everything securely, gives you a side-by-side view of applicants, and even suggests your best-fit candidates based on your criteria.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="stage-2-deeper-screening">Stage 2: Deeper Screening</h2>
<p>Once you‚Äôve got a handful of promising applicants, it‚Äôs time to get a little more personal.</p>
<p>Send them a request to connect (you can do this in TenantFit), and if they‚Äôre still interested, follow up with the <strong>Stage 2 Screening Form</strong>.</p>
<p>This version is more compact than Stage 1 but digs into:<br />
- Employment and income<br />
- Rental history<br />
- References<br />
- Consent for background checks</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a <a href="files/2025-07-06-tenantfit-background-screening-form-v1-onca.pdf" target="_blank">Stage 2 request form PDF</a> (coming soon) and a checklist of documents you might request.</p>
<h3 id="know-the-boundaries">‚öñÔ∏è Know the Boundaries</h3>
<p>Under the <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-human-rights-and-rental-housing#fnB1">Ontario Human Rights Code</a>, landlords <strong>cannot reject tenants</strong> because of:<br />
- Race, religion, ancestry, or place of origin<br />
- Citizenship or refugee status<br />
- Gender, sexual orientation, or pregnancy<br />
- Family or marital status<br />
- Disability or age<br />
- Receiving public assistance (like ODSP or OW)</p>
<p>Instead, landlords <strong>may consider</strong>:<br />
- Income (but not income ratios ‚Äî more on that below)<br />
- Credit checks and references<br />
- Rental history<br />
- Guarantors or co-signers</p>
<p>Also, while you can ask about pets, unless the property is a condo with specific rules, you <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/06r17#BK19">cannot legally prohibit tenants from having pets</a> once the lease is signed.</p>
<p>üîê Regarding documents: landlords <strong>should not request SIN</strong> or retain copies of ID unless absolutely necessary. Consent is always required before running background or credit checks.
