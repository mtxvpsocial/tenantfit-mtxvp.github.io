      <h1 class="mb-3">Tenant Screening Guide for Landlords in Ontario, Canada</h1>
  
        <p class="text-secondary">Jul 06, 2025 by <a href="#">mtxvp</a></p>
        <p>Tenant screening is a <strong>multi-stage process</strong> that needs to be carefully followed to help you find the best candidate for your rental property. This is one step you don’t want to compromise on — selecting a solid tenant will ensure your <strong>peace of mind</strong> for months (or even years) to come. A good tenant means a smoother landlord-tenant relationship, someone who takes care of your property, and a reliable income stream — while you provide a well-maintained space they can enjoy.</p>
<p>There are plenty of services and forms out there that help with tenant screening. But many of them jump right into asking for highly sensitive details like banking info, credit scores, and employment history. While these are useful later, going in too deep too soon can feel invasive — and turn away quality applicants.</p>
<p>📍 <em>Note: This and subsequent guides are written with Ontario, Canada in mind. If you're outside the province, please check your local laws and regulations.</em></p>
<p>At <strong>TenantFit</strong>, we believe that tenant candidates should have a chance to remain <strong>anonymous</strong> at the beginning of the process. Only after a landlord has narrowed down their shortlist should they request more personal information. This respects the privacy of applicants while giving landlords better control over their screening efforts.</p>
<p>This approach also helps landlords. In Ontario, you're <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/06r17#BK207">strongly discouraged from charging</a> tenants for background screening. So it makes sense to keep early screening light and only dive deep when it’s worth the effort.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="stage-1-pre-screening">Stage 1: Pre-Screening</h2>
<p>To collect initial information, you’ve got a couple of options.</p>
<p>📝 Option 1: Old School</p>
<p>Prefer pen and paper? You can use this <a href="files/2025-07-06-tenantfit-pre-screening-form-v1-onca.pdf" target="_blank">Pre-Screening application PDF form</a> and send it directly to the candidate. They print it, fill it out, scan it, and send it back. Then you manually assess who’s worth moving to the next step.</p>
<p>🌐 Option 2: Online (and easier!)</p>
<p><a href="https://tenantfit.mtxvp.com/#register" target="_blank">Register for free</a>, <a href="https://tenantfit.mtxvp.com/blog/tenantfit-open-registration/" target="_blank">add your property</a>, and send the link to the interactive form to candidates. They fill it in on their phone or computer, and you get clean, structured responses you can compare at a glance.</p>
<p>Here’s an example <a href="https://tenantfit.mtxvp.com/#publicProperty?id=03980949-b29d-47c2-a001-3b226f704788" target="_blank">public listing link</a>.</p>
<p>TenantFit stores everything securely, gives you a side-by-side view of applicants, and even suggests your best-fit candidates based on your criteria.</p>
<h3 id="detecting-red-flags-and-inconsistencies-early">Detecting red flags and inconsistencies early</h3>
<p>Before you go to the next step, take a moment to verify the pre-screening data for consistency. <br />
If you are using TenantFit to collect the pre-screening data, the app will give you an initial score advising how well the candidate answers matche your property. We are constantly evolving the approach, however you still want to double check some of the red flags listed below.</p>
<h4 id="current-housing-vs-reason-for-moving">Current Housing vs. Reason for Moving</h4>
<ul>
<li>Inconsistent or vague responses can be a sign of issues:<ul>
<li>Claims they own their home but list “moving because of eviction.”</li>
<li>"Living with friends" but lists prior landlord reference in Stage 2 (why not mentioning landlord now?).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>🚩 Look for vague or evasive answers like “just looking for a change.”</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rental-history-vs-time-at-current-address">Rental History vs. Time at Current Address</h4>
<ul>
<li>If they claim to have lived at 1 unit in the last 5 years but also say they've been at their current place for “less than 6 months” — ask for clarification.</li>
<li>🚩 Rapid moves (multiple units in 5 years, all under 12 months) may indicate instability or eviction history.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rent-payment-history-vs-reason-for-moving">Rent Payment History vs. Reason for Moving</h4>
<ul>
<li>If they admit to paying rent late but say they’re “moving because current landlord is selling,” it may not add up.</li>
<li>🚩 Conflict between reasons given and rental history is worth a follow-up.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="vehicle-ownership-vs-parking-needs">Vehicle Ownership vs. Parking Needs</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lists multiple vehicles but selects “1 parking space required” or none — could suggest parking congestion risk, or unregistered use of space.</li>
<li>🚩 Mentions motorcycles/boats but doesn’t ask about storage — check if this contradicts your lease terms.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="employment-stability-vs-income-level">Employment Stability vs. Income Level</h4>
<ul>
<li>High income reported but under “employment duration,” selects “Less than 6 months” — this could be a recent job or unverifiable claim.</li>
<li>🚩 Very high income + short employment time frame could need verification early.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="business-activity-in-unit">Business Activity in Unit</h4>
<ul>
<li>Says “No business activity” but selects “Self-employed” in occupation — follow up to clarify if they intend to work from home.</li>
<li>🚩 Some home businesses may violate lease terms, insurance rules, or zoning bylaws.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="unusual-field-vs-current-housing">Unusual Field vs. Current Housing</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lists a very high-salary profession (e.g. “corporate lawyer,” “surgeon”) but is “living with friends” or in temporary housing.</li>
<li>🚩 Could indicate fabricated info or financial instability.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="detecting-additional-discrepancies">Detecting additional discrepancies</h4>
<ul>
<li>Compare answers across fields: E.g., If they say they’ve rented before but check “no” on “rented from private landlord,” dig deeper.</li>
<li>Vague explanations: Short, generic answers like “NA” or “none” across the form may signal evasiveness.</li>
<li>Behavioral mismatch: If a candidate seems unusually eager, rushed, or overly flattering — this can also signal red flags worth investigating.</li>
<li>Income vs occupation: Does the income level match stated profession?</li>
<li>Lifestyle match: Can your property accommodate tenant's posession - e.g. if they indicate they have a boat, do you have parking available for that?</li>
<li>Do extended answers appear truthful? Do you notice any discrepancy there?</li>
</ul>
