      <h1 class="mb-3">Tenant Screening Guide for Landlords in Ontario, Canada - Part 2 - Background Screening</h1>
  
        <p class="text-secondary">Jul 10, 2025 by <a href="#">mtxvp</a></p>
        <p>See <a href="https://tenantfit.mtxvp.com/blog/tenant-screening-process-p1-prescreening/">Part 1 - Pre-Screening Guide</a>. </p>
<h1 id="collect-the-documents">Collect the documents</h1>
<p>Once you‚Äôve got a handful of promising applicants, it‚Äôs time to get a little more personal. Connect with your candidates via email, text or messenger app (you can also do this from within TenantFit). If they are still interested, follow up by sending the <a href="files/2025-07-06-tenantfit-background-screening-form-v1-onca.pdf" target="_blank">Background screening PDF form</a> to fill out, asking more details and a list of documents.</p>
<p>This form is more compact than pre-screening and asks for:<br />
- Employment and income<br />
- Rental history<br />
- References<br />
- Consent for background checks</p>
<p>You will need information about <strong>all the applicants</strong> whose name will appear later on the lease agreement.</p>
<h3 id="know-the-boundaries">‚öñÔ∏è Know the Boundaries</h3>
<p>It is important to note that under the <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-human-rights-and-rental-housing#fnB1">Ontario Human Rights Code</a>, landlords <strong>cannot reject tenants</strong> because of:<br />
- Race, religion, ancestry, or place of origin<br />
- Citizenship or refugee status<br />
- Gender, sexual orientation, or pregnancy<br />
- Family or marital status<br />
- Disability or age<br />
- Receiving public assistance (like ODSP or OW)</p>
<p>Instead, landlords <strong>may consider</strong>:<br />
- Income (but not income ratios ‚Äî more on that below)<br />
- Credit checks and references<br />
- Rental history<br />
- Guarantors or co-signers</p>
<p>Also, while you can ask about pets, unless the property is a condo with specific rules, you <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/06r17#BK19">cannot legally prohibit tenants from having pets</a> once the lease is signed.</p>
<p>üîê Regarding documents: landlords <strong>should not request SIN</strong> or retain copies of ID unless absolutely necessary. Consent is always required before running background or credit checks. More at <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/landlords-and-tenants/privacy-in-the-landlord-and-tenant-relationship/">OPC Privacy Guide</a>.</p>
<h1 id="performing-initial-background-checks">Performing initial background checks</h1>
<p>After some back and forth, once you have enough information and respective consents from candidates it‚Äôs time to validate the details.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üßæ <strong>Cross-check</strong> pre-screening answers with the documents you get from candidates. Are they consistent?</p>
<ul>
<li>Does tenant initial income answer matches what you see from their employment letter? (e.g., employment letter should match income band and tenure).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>üßç <strong>Contact previous landlords</strong> and ask few questions about the Applicant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do dates and addresses match?</li>
<li>Was rent paid on time or was the Applicant ever been late with rent? If so, how many times?</li>
<li>Did the Applicant ever receive a Notice to Vacate?</li>
<li>Was the Applicant evicted? If so, why?</li>
<li>Did you receive any complaints about Tenants? Any concerns from other neighbors?</li>
<li>Did the Applicant leave the Rental Unit in good condition and leave in good standing?</li>
<li>Would they rent to the person again?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíº <strong>Verify employment</strong>: With the advent of LLM AIs, it is not very hard to generate realistic looking employment and references letters. You want to use multiple channels to verify validity of the information candidates will give you. </p>
<ul>
<li>Pick up the phone and call the company, do internet search, drive to the specified address if possible.</li>
<li>Is the company real and seem legit?</li>
<li>Can they confirm the position and income?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>üí∞ <strong>Evaluate income</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there enough income to cover rent?</li>
<li>‚úÖ But remember: Ontario landlords <strong>cannot apply fixed income ratios</strong> (e.g., ‚Äúrent must be less than 30% of income‚Äù) ‚Äî see <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/human-rights-housing-overview-landlords-brochure">OHRC guidance</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verify social media</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If a candidate answers <strong>‚ÄúNo‚Äù</strong> to having pets or smoking but later their references, social media, or documents suggest otherwise, that‚Äôs a sign of dishonesty.</li>
<li>üö© Flag if a tenant selects "No pets" but later shares photos of pets or asks about pet-friendly features.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verify eviction or dispute history</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://openroom.ca/">OpenRoom</a>, <a href="https://landlordezy.ca/court-orders">LandlordEzy</a> provide search by name and address, so you can verify both for any LTB orders. <a href="https://www.canlii.org/on/onltb?origLang=en">CanLii</a> shows <a href="https://tribunalsontario.ca/ltb/">LTB</a> orders by docket and date.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Chances are by this stage you may have eliminated number of candidates due to various discrepancies and red flags, saving money on further steps. </p>
<h1 id="running-paid-background-checks">Running paid background checks</h1>
<p>Stressing again the importance of you having consent from every person that you will be running background checks for. Got it in place? Good. </p>
<p>First check with you realtor or lawyer - they might be able to help with this step. Barring that, now is time to take out your wallet and order the paid background checks.</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong> in Ontario landlord cannot charge application fees or ask candidates to pay for the background or criminal checks. </p>
<p>There are number of providers that can get the background checks performed for you. Here are few, and this list likely will change over time (list and prices as of July 2025): </p>
<ul>
<li>

<ul>
<li>Credit report, Background check bundle: $24.99  (<a href="https://frontlobby.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bundle-Package-CA.pdf">View sample</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.tuze.ca/tenant-report">Tuze</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Credit report, Background check bundle: $25.00 (<a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e69472ebbda69b708480a7/67e8bf1748a6bd0876b90d32_Tuze%20Sample%20Report.pdf">View sample</a>])</li>

<ul>
<li>Credit report, Public record search: $29.99 (<a href="https://app.singlekey.com/tenant-report">View sample</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've got the documents you would want to go through them with fine brush, checking every detail and cross checking all the information with the documents supplied by the applicants. Does all the information match? Are you comfortable with everything you see in the reports?</p>
